					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>Growing up, I experienced various challenges that caused me to develop a range of insecurities that drove me deep into my shell. In the two years since joining AIESEC, however, I have grown tremendously and I am liking the person I have metamorphosed into. This said, what is keeping me in the organization is endlessly seeking that every young person in the world can actually have the kind of personal and professional growth experience I have had through the opportunity to get engaged with AIESEC. If just half of the young people on the earth surface can understand our essence AIESEC will be a step closer to delivering these kinds of experiences and achieving AIESEC’s BHAG. I strongly believe in the power of ENABLING Disruptive TECHNOLOGY and the power of SOCIAL MEDIA with these two combined we can engage every young person in the world. For example, it was extremely exciting to have led the team that won the Microsoft UpgradeYourWorldKE Challenge for Kenya. This was huge for me because in AIESEC
in Kenya we have just 600 members and we won with 6,000 votes. The experience helped me to understand how many people we were able to engage through innovative technology utilizing solutions. I believe that this experience provides a good example of the kind of reach we can achieve on the global level.<br /><br />
<img class="img-responsive" src="img/Washing and Speaking.jpg">
<br />
We must understand that our vision is somewhat dependent on the achievement of our BHAG. The Peace and Fulfilment of Humankind’s potential, “Humankind’s” there includes everyone on the planet. Hence, for us to live up to our vision as an organization, considerable effort must be made to getting AIESEC out there on CNN, in conversations had in the White House and even in the Oval Office. It is for this reason that I have decided to stand for member of AIESEC International. Moreover, I see this as an opportunity to reach out to more than half of the countries on the globe (where AIESEC is present) in an attempt to make AIESEC viral and completely disruptive! This is also the core reason I have remained in the Marketing department of AIESEC almostsince I joined the organization; because I feel that the task of engaging every young person in the world largely lies on the Marketing Portfolio.<br />
<br />
Out of this experience, I look forward to becoming a better person after the experience keeping in mind the challenges and limitless opportunities ahead. I believe all these summed up together will birth a very challenging and intense AIESEC Experience. It goes without saying that, this would be the perfect way to bring my AIESEC journey to an end, properly ushering me into my PhD Degree in Architectural Marketing.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/Neil and Alums.jpg"><br />
						<p>For the world so far AIESEC has only just began to pull its weight in the “Youth-Empowerment scene”. From 1948 till date, we have been able to breed future leaders that have lead countries as Presidents, sat in very powerful offices in the UN also one of the past
Presidents of America is also an alumnus this is only to mention a few. The organization has so far lived up her end of creating leaders that will shape the world and make it a better place.<br /><br />
<img class="img-responsive" src="img/In the oval office.jpg"></br>
The AIESEC I envision is gradually becoming a reality. The relationship we currently nurture with the United Nations especially as the organization at the fore front of spear heading the Sustainable Development Goals. The AIESEC I envision is one in which the President of America cannot make any decisions regarding young people without consulting the President of AIESEC International. I envision an AIESEC where the AIESEC International year plan is review by world leaders (country Presidents) to ensure that their countries benefit of the AIESEC programmes.<br /><br /></p>
